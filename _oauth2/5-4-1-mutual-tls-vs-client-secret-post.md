# Client authentication - Mutual TLS (TLS bound token) VS Client secret post

Here's a comparison table in markdown format that highlights the differences between Client Secret Post and Mutual TLS (TLS bound token) in terms of security:

| Authentication Scheme | Client Secret Post | Mutual TLS (TLS bound token) |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Transport Security     | HTTP/HTTPS         | TLS                           |
| Client Identification | Client ID and Secret in Request Body | Client Certificate |
| Credential Exposure    | Exposed in Request Body | Not Exposed |
| Credential Storage     | On Client           | On Authorization Server |
| Authentication Strength | Moderate             | Strong                        |
| Configuration Complexity | Low               | High                          |


Client Secret Post and Mutual TLS (TLS bound token) are two different authentication schemes in OAuth2 that provide secure ways for clients to authenticate with the authorization server and access protected resources. 

Client Secret Post authentication involves sending the client identifier and client secret in the request body as form-encoded parameters when requesting an access token from the authorization server. This authentication scheme provides a more secure way for clients to authenticate themselves to the authorization server during the OAuth2 flow than Client Secret Basic, as the credentials are not exposed in the HTTP headers.

On the other hand, Mutual TLS (TLS bound token) involves using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a secure connection between the client and the authorization server, and binding the access token to the client's TLS certificate. This authentication scheme provides a stronger security guarantee than Client Secret Post, as it ensures that only the authorized client with a valid TLS certificate can access protected resources.

In terms of security, Mutual TLS (TLS bound token) is considered more secure than Client Secret Post. This is because Mutual TLS provides an additional layer of security by establishing a secure connection between the client and the authorization server, and binding the access token to the client's TLS certificate, which ensures that only the authorized client with a valid TLS certificate can access protected resources. 

However, Mutual TLS (TLS bound token) may require additional configuration on both the client and server side to support, while Client Secret Post is widely supported by OAuth2 providers and requires less configuration.

Ultimately, the choice between Client Secret Post and Mutual TLS (TLS bound token) depends on the specific security and support requirements of the client application. If stronger security guarantees are required, Mutual TLS (TLS bound token) is the preferred choice. If ease of implementation and wide support are important factors, then Client Secret Post may be a better choice.
