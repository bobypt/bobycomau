OAuth2 is an open standard for authorization that enables secure access to APIs. It is widely used in modern application development to grant access to protected resources without exposing sensitive credentials such as usernames and passwords. Java Spring Boot is a popular framework for building web applications, and it provides built-in support for OAuth2. Learning OAuth2 by practice using Java Spring Boot is an effective way to understand how OAuth2 works and how it can be implemented in real-world applications.

If you are a java developer familiar with spring boot, then this series is for you. Spring Boot provides a number of features to simplify the process of building web applications, including support for RESTful APIs, database integration, and security.

### Features and Benefits
 - **Start a local OAuth2 AUth server, Resource server, sample client and a dateway server using couple of simple commands.**
 - You can enable java logs and see **http wire logs** and http traffic between client->OAuth server, client->Resource server and Resource server->OAuth server
 - Configure different types of **OAuth grant types, oAuth client authentication, tokens** etc.
 - Make changes and build your expertise slowly.
 - **Postman collection** provided can be used to see sample requests and response.
 - Import the code to your favourite IDE and **run / debug** inside your IDE eg: Intellij, eclipse, VSCode etc


Learning OAuth2 by practice using Java Spring Boot is an effective way to gain a deep understanding of how OAuth2 works and how it can be implemented in real-world applications. By building and testing your own OAuth2-enabled applications, you can develop the skills and knowledge needed to build secure and reliable applications. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, learning OAuth2 with Spring Boot is a valuable skill that can help you build better applications and advance your career.
