## Introduction 

API security is a crucial aspect of modern application development. An API, or application programming interface, is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. APIs allow different applications to interact with each other, enabling developers to create complex and dynamic software solutions. However, as APIs become more prevalent and are used in a wider range of applications, security concerns arise. One way to address these concerns is through the use of OAuth2.

OAuth2 is an open standard for authorization that enables secure access to APIs. OAuth2 enables applications to grant access to their APIs without exposing sensitive credentials such as usernames and passwords. Instead, OAuth2 uses tokens to authenticate requests and grant access to resources.

If you are an API developer, it is important to understnad the concepts and possibilities with OAuth2 so that you can pick the right method for your problem. Best way to learn the concepts are by getting your hands dirty and trying it yourself.

If you are a java developer, familiar with spring boot, this series is for you. OAuth playground is built using java and spring boot so that you can get your hands dirty and play with it. You can get under the hood, and see how exactly different pieces hang together.
