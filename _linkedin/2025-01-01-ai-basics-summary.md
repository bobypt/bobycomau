Hook options (pick one and refine when posting):

- Most teams jump into agents before getting AI basics right. Here are 3 fundamentals I check before building anything autonomous.
- Before you ship an agent to prod, make sure you can answer these 3 basic questions about your AI system.

Core points:

- AI is not magic: clarify objective, constraints, and failure modes first.
- LLMs are pattern machines, not databases—wrap them with tools, memory, and guardrails.
- Autonomy without evaluation is just a fancy way to say "uncontrolled script".

Call to action:

- If you're thinking about agentic AI for your team, start by tightening your foundations. I broke down my checklist here: /ai/basics
