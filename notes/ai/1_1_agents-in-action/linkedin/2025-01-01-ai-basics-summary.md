Hook options (pick one and refine when posting):

- It’s Monday 8am and your agents have already been working for hours: triaging tickets, scaling infra, summarizing overnight research. That’s not sci-fi—that’s where we’re heading.
- In a few years you won’t “check your tools”, you’ll “check what your agents did while you were sleeping”.

Core points:

- Enterprises will run **fleets of narrow agents**: support triage, runbook executors, observability copilots.
- Small businesses will rely on **2–3 high‑leverage agents** instead of whole departments.
- Individuals will have **multiple personal agents** for calendar, learning, and life admin—not one monolithic “AI butler”.

Call to action:

- I sketched out this “world of agents” and how to think about it in the first article of my Agentic AI series here: /ai/agents-in-action
